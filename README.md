# Rust chess library

## Usage

The library can be found in the `chess` subdirectory. Run `cargo doc --open` to
view the documentation.

An example project using the library with an unnecessary amount of comments can
be found in the `chess_cli` subdirectory. It implements a simple command-line
interface to play chess.
